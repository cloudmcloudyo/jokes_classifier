       "12708  Got called a fat black bitch for not selling tobacco to some foreigners with no ID. Not going to go too much into detail but basically Asshole A had no ID for his cigar purchase so he asked Asshole B to present his ID. I told him that Asshole A needs to show an ID or I can’t make the sale. Asshole B goes to the car and gets Asshole C who proceeds to show his ID and is told by the other cashier that she can’t take his ID since she witnessed that the purchase was for Asshole A. Long story short, Asshole C starts screaming in my face and telling me I’m a fat, stupid, black bitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "17082  Train to Hawaii A bit of a back story, I was a travel agent in Orlando, FL in the 90’s.  I loved my job for the most part.  I was boggled frequently by people’s lack of geographic knowledge.  Onto the quick story.\\n\\nI had a woman call me up one day inquiring about going to Hawaii.  Great!  Hawaii is a great destination, lots to see, lots to do and expensive... more commissions for me.\\n\\nD - ding bat and M - for me\\n\\nD - I would like to go to Hawaii:\\n\\nM- Great, where would you like to fly into?  Maui, Honolulu?? (Cuts me off)\\n\\nD- Well first me and my husband are going to drive out to California and then take the train.\\n\\nM- (a bit confused) Ok, so you are going to drive to California and take a train from where?\\n\\nD- That’s why I called you!  Where does the train leave from in California to Hawaii??\\n\\nM- Ma’am, there isn’t a train that goes to Hawaii.  Hawaii is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nD- Well, I know that!  I’m looking at a map the States and Hawaii is just off the coast of California.  So, if the train doesn’t go there how long is the bridge to drive to Honolulu?\\n\\nM- Sorry, you can’t drive either.  You will have to fly.\\n\\nD- I can’t do that, I scared of flying.  Then hangs up on me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

This was also automotive paint as there was a picture of a car on the spray can\\n\\nMe:  I'm afraid not, this is for the grill of a car.\\n\\nC:  But it says grills on it.\\n\\nMe:  Yes, but this is not for an outdoor grill, it's for an automotive grill.\\n\\nC:  But it says grills.\\n\\nAt this point, I can tell that this is going nowhere, so I change tactics. \\n\\nMe:  This is automotive paint.

Easily the cutest thing I've ever seen there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "14538  Does a restaurant story count? I didnt work at this restaurant, but I have a funny story, so, me and my family were  at a steakhouse and my brother got mashed potatoes with his Meal, the potatoes he got had a hair in them. My parents said he should tell the servers, but my brother is the most nonconfrontation person ever, so he just kept eating them. When my parents got a waiters attention he said \"it's just 2 little hairs it's fine\" the waiters were very kind to us and got him a fresh plate of potatoes. They had to take the one with the hairs away from him because he kept eating them. They ended up giving him his meal for free but the fact that he kept eating them probably entertained the staff                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "17509  “God wiling you go to the hell fires” I am not involved in this but I just witnessed it and thought it belonged here. \\n\\nI was in line for a merry-go-round at a theme park and one father was sitting on the horse with a baby on his laps, now this was not just a baby it was basically a newborn, no more than 3 months. He was so tiny and wasn’t even moving his arms. The lady who was running the ride went up to him and said that because the baby was so young, and because the father was an adult they both had to ride on this carriage that was not high off the ground. \\n\\nNow this man had a huge ego and would not get off. He kept yelling at this poor lady who is just following the rules. Eventually after around 2 minutes of yelling the lady went and called some supervisors. The 2 men came to the father and kept telling him but he wouldn’t listen, eventually after 5 minutes of the ride being delayed he got off and say in the carriage and told the lady after the supervisors left: “god willing you go to the hell fires”.\\n\\nI felt so bad for this lady because she was just making sure 1. The baby wouldn’t get hurt, 2. She doesn’t get fired for not enforcing the rules.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\nMan in merry-go-round wouldn’t take his newborn son off the horse for safety reasons and after fight with workers and supervisors he caved and wished hell on the lady.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

A family member of mine owns a jewelry store, so it's not uncommon for me to stop by to help him. \\n\\n  Last week, a costumer came in with a furry white thing around his neck, and after a closer look, I realized it was a mouse. A huge rat. Here in my country it is not common to have pet rats.

One if the $5 (US) looked weird and when we both looked st it again we realized it was a really old bill. Like it was from the 50s. He was so amused that I noticed it and commented on how my eyesight must be really good to have noticed since he has been carrying it around and never noticed it.  \\n  \\nI'm borderline legally blind.

       "18291  What do you mean you can change tracks for trains? I have to travel a long way to work every day. The weather here in Toronto was really bad a few days ago to Go Trains were running slow. My train was 30 mins late because of track conditions.   \\nWhen I finally get into one, this lady is talking to the transit officer about how she saw a train go west on the same track just 10 minutes before the scheduled time so there was no way the train could have come back east in time. She had no idea that they can send a different train and change tracks for them lmao.  \\n\\n\\nLady: Do you think we passengers are stupid? I saw the train go west. I knew it would have never made back in time. Why can't you people plan better.  \\nOfficer: Ma'am, we know trains cannot make back in time. Which is why you get a different train not the same one.  \\nLady: Even if it is a different one, two trains cannot run on the same track now can they?  \\nOfficer: We can change tracks for the trains ma'am.  \\nLady: What do you mean you can change tracks?  \\n\\n\\nAnd he worked his very hard to explain how the railway system works.

There's a lot of empty shelves, is that cause people are panic buying cause of that Corona-virus that's on the news?” \\n\\nI smile politely and say “Yes, I'm afraid so.” \\n\\nShe gently tuts to herself and plainly says. “Huh, what a bunch of fucking idiots.” after which she simply walked off.   \\n\\nIt's been a stressful one today but that put a smile on my face for a good while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "9949   Handicapped Accessible This happened a few years ago but we had 2 large unisex bathrooms with a long metal bar by the toilet for making it handicap accessible along with lots of space for a wheelchair. \\n\\nAnyways that day we didn’t receive toilet paper for our restrooms and we had the last of it in the bathrooms. Now you know the kind of toilet paper dispensers that hold the large rolls, normal toilet paper cannot fit. We contacted them and we would be receiving it in the morning. In the mean time we placed bought rolls of toilet paper in there in case it ran out. \\n\\nA lady in a wheelchair and her husband came in and they went into the one restroom. She came out screaming at me because our bathroom almost made her fall and hurt herself. Someone had placed ONE roll on the hand rail to use (mind you the hand rail is about 3 feet long) and because someone sat one there she had no where to hold onto the rail. She also yelled because we were discriminating against her and it was extremely unsanitary. \\n\\nI apologized and told her unfortunately we don’t have access until morning to anymore of the rolls of TP for the dispensers. But that we were trying to keep the restrooms open for customers in the meantime. She continued by telling me that she was going to call the Health Department to tell them what we did and get us in trouble along with other outlets to make us “pay”. \\n\\nIt still baffles me... no one forced her to use our bathroom! And her finding the TP unsanitary for being sat out... little does she know that several times we had men piss up into the dispenser. At least with it out you can see if it’s clean or not.   \n",

So I answered, \"haha yeah\" and she goes, \"REALLY?\"\\n\\nI then explained to her that it was a phone call for the frozen department, and that there was no one that worked there named Frozen.

'Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?'\\n\\n'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat!'\\n\\nAfter a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?'\\n\\n'Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.'\\n\\n'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!'\\n\\n'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'\\n\\n'My, that's a lot!', gasped Mrs. Smith.\\n\\n'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'\\n\\n'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Smith quietly.\\n\\nThe photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said.\\n\\n'Oh, my God!' Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.\\n\\n'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'\\n\\n'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Smith.\\n\\n'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look'\\n\\n'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.\\n\\n'Yes', the photographer replied. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.'\\n\\nMrs. Smith leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh....equipment?'\\n\\n'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'\\n\\n'Tripod?'\\n\\n'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on.

You will be immediately placed at the top of the S.H.I.T. list, and our lecturers are especially skilled at seeing that you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.\\n\\nStudents who don't take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in Departmental Educational Evaluation Programs (D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T.). Those who fail to take D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go to Educational Attitude Training (E.A.T. S.H.I.T.). Since our lecturers took S.H.I.T. before they graduated, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. anymore, and are all full of S.H.I.T. already.\\n\\nIf you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be interested in a job teaching others. We can add your name to our Basic Understanding Lecture List (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).\\n\\nFor students who are intending to pursue a career in management and consultancy, we will refer you to the department of Managerial Operational Research Education (M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.).

       "      <td>Long, dumb jokes like THE ARISTOCRATS, Neil Hamburger's \"No Air on Mars\" or Norm McDonald's Moth joke. Anyone know any? Here's one I heard when I was 10. A third grade boy is walking to school and overhears two older girls talking about a \"pink flower\". They notice him there and instantly stop talking.\\n\\nSo, he gets to school and when the class is all taking their seats, he asks the teacher \"Hey, Ms. Rubinslapper, on the way to school today, I heard these two  middle school girls talking about a pink flower, like it was some kind of big secret. What's a pink flower?\"\\n\\nThe teacher's face goes red.\\n\\n\"You filthy, disgusting child. You make me SICK! Get out of my sight! Go to the principal's office right now!\"\\n\\nKid is rather shocked, doesn't know what he's done wrong. Goes to the principal's office (for the first time!) and walks in. The principal, Mr. Hornflogger, is surprised. \"Johnny... what are you doing here?\" he asks. \\n\\nJohnny, sheepishly replies \"Well, Mr. Hornflogger, I was walking to school this morning. I heard these two middle school  girls talking about a pink flower. It seemed like some interesting thing, so when I got to class this morning, I asked Ms. Rubinslapper what a pink flower was. She got really angry!\"\\n\\nThe boy starts to break down a bit. \"I don't know what I've done wrong, Principal Hornflogger! What is so bad about what I did? What is a pink flower?\"\\n\\nThe principal's face goes red, and a vein in his forehead starts pulsating like it's about to erupt.\\n\\n\"You filthy, repulsive sick child! How dare you bring up such subjects around other people, much less AT SCHOOL! I have never encountered such foul behavior from a child. YOU ARE HEREBY EXPELLED!\"\\n\\nSo Johnny cleans out his locker, starts walking home. He arrives home around 10am, and his mother is very surprised.\\n\\n\"Johnny, what are you doing home so early? Are you sick? Why didn't the school call?\"\\n\\nJohnny is near-blubbering by now. \"Well, Mom, I was walking to school today as usual, and I heard these two middle school girls talking about a “pink flower”. I didn’t know what it meant, but it sounded like something important, so when I got to school, I asked Ms. Rubinslapper what a pink flower was, and she got really mad and sent me to Principal Hornflogger’s office. I don’t know what I was doing wrong, so I asked him what a pink flower was. He got really angry too and expelled me right on the spot! Mom, I don’t understand what is happening to me today! What is a “pink flower”? What did I do wrong?!?”\\n\\nThe mother sits down at the kitchen table and her voice starts breaking. \\n\\n“Ever since you were born, your father and I have done our best to bring you up to be a good boy, a good boy who has morals and follows the rules just like everyone else. Here, today, I find out that I’m a failure as a mother. How could I not see you turning into the revolting piece of human trash you are now? What did I do wrong?”\\n\\n“Mom?”\\n\\n“GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE! I never want to see you again!” seethes the mother. \\n\\nSo Johnny is walking down the street, just crying hiccup-tears, dragging all his belongings in a big duffel bag, pausing each block to sob uncontrollably. \\n\\nA policeman passes by. Oh, it’s Officer McClotchkey, the local constable. He knows Johnny and his friends well, and often plays street hockey with them. \\n\\n“Johnny… what’s all this?!? What’s the matter? Why are you crying? Why aren’t you in school?!?”… he’s genuinely concerned. \\n\\n“Well (sniff) Officer McClotchkey, I was walking to school this morning and I overheard two middle school girls talking about this thing called… I don’t want to say what it is…”\\n\\n“Oh, come on Johnny, if there’s something you need to talk about, just tell me. Are you in some kind of trouble?” says the officer.\\n\\n“Well, these two girls (sob) were talking about a “pink flower” like it was some kind of secret… or code or something, I don’t know. It sounded like a normal thing to me, so I went to school and I asked my teacher what a pink flower was, and she got really mad and sent me to the principal’s office. I asked the principal what a pink flower was, and he expelled me from school! I got home and asked my mom what a pink flower was, and she got so angry that she kicked me out of the house!”, the boy half-scream, half-sobbed to the cop.\\n\\n“Officer McClotchkey, I don’t understand what is so wrong with what I did! What’s a pink flower?!?”\\n\\nThe cop’s demeanor instantly shifts. No longer the sympathetic neighborhood constable, he barks, “Well I’ve never in my 20 years on the force heard such foul rubbish out of one of you kids here in the neighborhood. I wish I could arrest you, but I can’t. But I want you out of this town IMMEDIATELY. You should just join the damn army!”\\n\\nSo the kid, out of resources and out of ideas, thinks “Maybe I will.”\\n\\nSo he goes, joins up, and is soon overseas in (insert name of country that is currently a warzone). \\n\\nHe’s walking down the street and he sees a much higher-ranked officer, and salutes. The officer notices the boy and is surprised that someone of such obvious young age is in an army uniform, carrying a rifle.\\n\\n“Private, I’m surprised that someone as young as you joined up. You look like a nice kid, what the hell are you doing in this hellhole?”\\n\\n“Well, sir…” the boy is weary of telling the story by now, but he obliges the officer. “I was walking to school one day a few months ago, and I heard these two older girls talking about something called a “pink flower”. I didn’t know what it was, so when I got to school, I asked my teacher what a pink flower was. She got really angry and sent me to the principal’s office. I asked the principal what I had done wrong, and I asked him what a pink flower was. He got angry too and kicked me out of school forever! I went home and asked my mom, and she kicked me out of the house and has now disowned me! Then when I was on the streets of my town, I saw a police officer I knew, and when I asked him what a pink flower was, he threatened to arrest me, and he told me to leave town and join the army. And now I’m here.”\\n\\nThe officer pauses, and replies “Pink flower, huh.”\\n\\n“Yes sir. A pink flower. Do you know what a pink flower is, sir?”\\n\\nThe officer’s face turns beet red “Well never in my years of service to these armed forces have I met a recruit as treasonous and disgusting as you! You’re a disgrace and an insult to the uniform! I’m court-martialing you right now, and I shall recommend a dishonorable discharge! Now get out of my sight!”\\n\\nThe boy is completely defeated. He has nowhere to go. He starts to walk and suddenly he gets run over by a tank.\\n\\nWhat’s the moral of the story?\\n\\nLook both ways before you cross the street.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey, it happens as you get older NSFW\\n\\n30 years ago I saw a sideshow that touted, \"Harold, the Magnificent Jew\"\\n\\nIntrigued I paid the entrance fee and had a seat in tent with about 50 others.\\n\\nIn the back of the tent was a table on a small stage. The sideshow barker came out with a large fellow in just a bathrobe he introduced as Harold The Magnificent Jew!\\n\\nThe barker then placed 3 whole walnuts spaced out across the table. As a drum roll began off stage the big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK shattering each walnut with his penis. The crowd goes wild with applause.\\n\\nFast forward 30 yrs and I happen to find myself in that same part of town. Sure enough that sideshow tent was still there with the same banner advertising \\n\"Harold, The Magnificent Jew\". I think to myself this can't be the same guy. So curiosity gets the best of me &amp;amp; I again pay the entrance fee.\\n\\nSure enough the stage barker intros the big fellow, now grey and a little hunched over as Harold, The Magnificent Jew. Only this time the barker sets up 3 coconuts across the table. \\n\\nAgain big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK shattering each coconut with his penis. The crowd goes wild with applause.\\n\\nBefore I leave I happen to catch Harold and tell him I first saw his performance 30yrs ago. But that he crushed walnuts back then. So I asked him, what's with him using coconuts now?\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh he confided to me, \"Vell, i have to tell you young man. One day you may have this happen to you too. So if you please don't think too harshly of me.  My apologies but you just have to understand after 30 yrs: \\n\\nMy eyesight just isn't as good as it used to be!</td>\n",

       "2586  John and Karen were a devoted satanic couple They regularly had to perform a ritual, offering some of their blood, otherwise satan would take their souls away imediately.\\n\\nSo one day, Karen went to the store to buy some salt and scented candles for performing the said ritual.\\n\\n3 hours passed, until she finally came back home with a plastic bag and a huge smile in her face. John was very worried, and at the same time confused to what was she so happy about. So he asks: “My dear, what took you so long?”\\n\\n“Well, I went straight to that stupid Chinese manager, as usual, to ask him why wasn’t the salt and the scented candles placed where I wanted them to be. However, he definitely changed his attitude compared to last time! He immediately apologized, remembered me that today is the day that Satan’s birthday is celebrated all over China, and we both ended up doing the ritual over there on the back of the store. After it was over, he gave me this plastic bag with everything I would need.”\\n\\nSo John looks inside the plastic bag, only to find sugar, flour and some small birthday candles.\\n\\n“but Karen, these are not exactly the ritual materials, he seems to have fooled you! how am I going to perform the ritual with these?!”\\n\\n“Oh don’t worry dear, that’s going to be a piece of cake”

       "7209  making a baby The Smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, 'Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon.'\\n\\nHalf an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.\\n'Good morning, Ma'am', he said, 'I've come to...'\\n\\n'Oh, no need to explain,' Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, 'I've been expecting you.'\\n\\n'Have you really?' said the photographer. 'Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?'\\n\\n'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat!'\\n\\nAfter a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?'\\n\\n'Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.'\\n\\n'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!'\\n\\n'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'\\n\\n'My, that's a lot!', gasped Mrs. Smith.\\n\\n'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'\\n\\n'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Smith quietly.\\n\\nThe photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said.\\n\\n'Oh, my God!' Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.\\n\\n'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'\\n\\n'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Smith.\\n\\n'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look'\\n\\n'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.\\n\\n'Yes', the photographer replied. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.'\\n\\nMrs. Smith leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh....equipment?'\\n\\n'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'\\n\\n'Tripod?'\\n\\n'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big to be held in the hand very long.'\\n\\nMrs. Smith fainted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1451  Insurance Three men are sitting on a bench in their fancy retirement community in Florida\\nSteve says: \"I started with a men's clothing shop and built the business into the finest department store in town. One day there was a fire and it destroyed everything. Since I was too old to begin again, I took the insurance money and retired - and here I am.\"\\n\\nBen says: \"I had a hardware store downtown. It was the finest hardware store in the city. One Friday evening after closing time a pipe burst and flooded the store. On Monday morning I came in to discover that my entire inventory had been ruined. Like you, I was too old to start again, so I took the insurance money and retired down here to Florida.\"\\n\\nBilly says: \"I had a pharmacy in the Midwest. I was very successful, and had seven pharmacists working for me. However, one night a tornado came and picked up my entire store, utterly destroying it. I came the next morning and there was no pharmacy there! I was already a senior citizen so I took the insurance money and moved to Florida.\"\\n\\nSteve and Ben look utterly confused.

       "712   Full of S.H.I.T. In order to assure the highest levels of quality work and productivity from students, it will be our policy to keep all students well taught through our program of Special High Intensity Teaching (S.H.I.T.). We are trying to give our students more S.H.I.T. than anyone else.\\n\\nIf you feel that you do not receive your share of S.H.I.T. on the course, please see your lecturer. You will be immediately placed at the top of the S.H.I.T. list, and our lecturers are especially skilled at seeing that you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.\\n\\nStudents who don't take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in Departmental Educational Evaluation Programs (D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T.). Those who fail to take D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go to Educational Attitude Training (E.A.T. S.H.I.T.). Since our lecturers took S.H.I.T. before they graduated, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. anymore, and are all full of S.H.I.T. already.\\n\\nIf you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be interested in a job teaching others. We can add your name to our Basic Understanding Lecture List (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).\\n\\nFor students who are intending to pursue a career in management and consultancy, we will refer you to the department of Managerial Operational Research Education (M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.). This course emphasizes on how to manage M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.\\n\\nIf you have further questions, please direct them to our Head Of Teaching, Special High Intensity Training (H.O.T. S.H.I.T.).\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\nBoss In General\\nSpecial High Intensity Teaching\\n(B.I.G.

       "1388  Long, dumb jokes like THE ARISTOCRATS, Neil Hamburger's \"No Air on Mars\" or Norm McDonald's Moth joke. Anyone know any? Here's one I heard when I was 10. A third grade boy is walking to school and overhears two older girls talking about a \"pink flower\". They notice him there and instantly stop talking.\\n\\nSo, he gets to school and when the class is all taking their seats, he asks the teacher \"Hey, Ms. Rubinslapper, on the way to school today, I heard these two  middle school girls talking about a pink flower, like it was some kind of big secret. What's a pink flower?\"\\n\\nThe teacher's face goes red.\\n\\n\"You filthy, disgusting child. You make me SICK! Get out of my sight! Go to the principal's office right now!\"\\n\\nKid is rather shocked, doesn't know what he's done wrong. Goes to the principal's office (for the first time!) and walks in. The principal, Mr. Hornflogger, is surprised. \"Johnny... what are you doing here?\" he asks. \\n\\nJohnny, sheepishly replies \"Well, Mr. Hornflogger, I was walking to school this morning. I heard these two middle school  girls talking about a pink flower. It seemed like some interesting thing, so when I got to class this morning, I asked Ms. Rubinslapper what a pink flower was. She got really angry!\"\\n\\nThe boy starts to break down a bit. \"I don't know what I've done wrong, Principal Hornflogger! What is so bad about what I did? What is a pink flower?\"\\n\\nThe principal's face goes red, and a vein in his forehead starts pulsating like it's about to erupt.\\n\\n\"You filthy, repulsive sick child! How dare you bring up such subjects around other people, much less AT SCHOOL! I have never encountered such foul behavior from a child. YOU ARE HEREBY EXPELLED!\"\\n\\nSo Johnny cleans out his locker, starts walking home. He arrives home around 10am, and his mother is very surprised.\\n\\n\"Johnny, what are you doing home so early? Are you sick? Why didn't the school call?\"\\n\\nJohnny is near-blubbering by now. \"Well, Mom, I was walking to school today as usual, and I heard these two middle school girls talking about a “pink flower”. I didn’t know what it meant, but it sounded like something important, so when I got to school, I asked Ms. Rubinslapper what a pink flower was, and she got really mad and sent me to Principal Hornflogger’s office. I don’t know what I was doing wrong, so I asked him what a pink flower was. He got really angry too and expelled me right on the spot! Mom, I don’t understand what is happening to me today! What is a “pink flower”? What did I do wrong?!?”\\n\\nThe mother sits down at the kitchen table and her voice starts breaking. \\n\\n“Ever since you were born, your father and I have done our best to bring you up to be a good boy, a good boy who has morals and follows the rules just like everyone else. Here, today, I find out that I’m a failure as a mother. How could I not see you turning into the revolting piece of human trash you are now? What did I do wrong?”\\n\\n“Mom?”\\n\\n“GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE! I never want to see you again!” seethes the mother. \\n\\nSo Johnny is walking down the street, just crying hiccup-tears, dragging all his belongings in a big duffel bag, pausing each block to sob uncontrollably. \\n\\nA policeman passes by. Oh, it’s Officer McClotchkey, the local constable. He knows Johnny and his friends well, and often plays street hockey with them. \\n\\n“Johnny… what’s all this?!? What’s the matter? Why are you crying? Why aren’t you in school?!?”… he’s genuinely concerned. \\n\\n“Well (sniff) Officer McClotchkey, I was walking to school this morning and I overheard two middle school girls talking about this thing called… I don’t want to say what it is…”\\n\\n“Oh, come on Johnny, if there’s something you need to talk about, just tell me. Are you in some kind of trouble?” says the officer.\\n\\n“Well, these two girls (sob) were talking about a “pink flower” like it was some kind of secret… or code or something, I don’t know. It sounded like a normal thing to me, so I went to school and I asked my teacher what a pink flower was, and she got really mad and sent me to the principal’s office. I asked the principal what a pink flower was, and he expelled me from school! I got home and asked my mom what a pink flower was, and she got so angry that she kicked me out of the house!”, the boy half-scream, half-sobbed to the cop.\\n\\n“Officer McClotchkey, I don’t understand what is so wrong with what I did! What’s a pink flower?!?”\\n\\nThe cop’s demeanor instantly shifts. No longer the sympathetic neighborhood constable, he barks, “Well I’ve never in my 20 years on the force heard such foul rubbish out of one of you kids here in the neighborhood. I wish I could arrest you, but I can’t. But I want you out of this town IMMEDIATELY. You should just join the damn army!”\\n\\nSo the kid, out of resources and out of ideas, thinks “Maybe I will.”\\n\\nSo he goes, joins up, and is soon overseas in (insert name of country that is currently a warzone). \\n\\nHe’s walking down the street and he sees a much higher-ranked officer, and salutes. The officer notices the boy and is surprised that someone of such obvious young age is in an army uniform, carrying a rifle.\\n\\n“Private, I’m surprised that someone as young as you joined up. You look like a nice kid, what the hell are you doing in this hellhole?”\\n\\n“Well, sir…” the boy is weary of telling the story by now, but he obliges the officer. “I was walking to school one day a few months ago, and I heard these two older girls talking about something called a “pink flower”. I didn’t know what it was, so when I got to school, I asked my teacher what a pink flower was. She got really angry and sent me to the principal’s office. I asked the principal what I had done wrong, and I asked him what a pink flower was. He got angry too and kicked me out of school forever! I went home and asked my mom, and she kicked me out of the house and has now disowned me! Then when I was on the streets of my town, I saw a police officer I knew, and when I asked him what a pink flower was, he threatened to arrest me, and he told me to leave town and join the army. And now I’m here.”\\n\\nThe officer pauses, and replies “Pink flower, huh.”\\n\\n“Yes sir. A pink flower. Do you know what a pink flower is, sir?”\\n\\nThe officer’s face turns beet red “Well never in my years of service to these armed forces have I met a recruit as treasonous and disgusting as you! You’re a disgrace and an insult to the uniform! I’m court-martialing you right now, and I shall recommend a dishonorable discharge! Now get out of my sight!”\\n\\nThe boy is completely defeated. He has nowhere to go. He starts to walk and suddenly he gets run over by a tank.\\n\\nWhat’s the moral of the story?\\n\\nLook both ways before you cross the street.   \n",
       "292   I just got a new motorcycle... I just got a new motorcycle, in fact my first one.  \\nI was so happy that I decided to go the Shrine in the top of a near mountain to get it blessed.  \\nEverything was fine until a few miles before the slope even beings I saw a police control area, as it was my first bike I didn't have a license yet, I even haven't got the registration for the bike, I tought that I was screwed, then I got an idea.  \\nI got off from the bike and I started pushing it, when I reach the control the cop ask me what I was doing with the bike, so I told them, that when I started saving for my bike I promise that when I get it I would go the shrine pushing it.  \\nThe cop hear my story and let me pass astonished about my determination, I though, after a a mile I hop in again and here we go, but after a few meters I hear something behind me, it was a patrol car, so I ask them, anything that I can do for you officers? they told me:  \\n\"We all were so impressed about your determination that we decided to escort you to keep you safe\"

       "4761  Went down the pub... I went to a pub yesterday evening and ordered a pint. As the landlord put my drink down, I asked him for the wifi code because I needed to check a message.\\n\\n\"Oh no\" he said, \"No wifi in here, people used to sit talking in pubs, about their day, their families, work, politics, music, the lot. Now people just stare at their phones and it breaks my heart to see. Therefore, no wifi in this pub.\"\\n\\n\"You know what?\" I replied, \"You're right\" and I put my phone away.\\n\\n\"Thank you\", the landlord said \"In this pub I want you to act as you would twenty years ago\".\\n\\nSo I lit a cigarette, gave him 50p for the pint and said \"Two can play at that game mate.\"

       "4648  The wrestling match was about to begin... ...and the Contender's coach was once again lecturing the Contender.\\n\\n\"If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times-don't let the Champion get you in The Pretzel! No one has ever been able to get out of The Pretzel!\"\\n\\nThe Contender nodded his head, getting ready for the match. \"I know, Coach, if you've told me once...I won't let him get me in The Pretzel!\"\\n\\n\"Good! Just don't let him get you in The Pretzel!\"\\n\\n\"Coach!\"\\n\\nThe crowd in the arena was roaring. The two wrestlers moved to ring, a well lit white square in the center of the seats. The Contender was called and the crowd cheered, then the Champion was called and the crowd roared.\\n\\nCoach called to the Contender \"Don't let him get you in The Pretzel!\", and the Contender nodded and moved into the center. After a few moments, the match began. \\n\\nCoach watched as the wrestlers twisted together, all power and speed. The crowd surged. The bodies on the mat became a twisted wreck.\\n\\n\"The Pretzel...\" the Coach whispered, reaching to throw the towel into the ring, knowing there was no way the Contender could win. Before he could, though, there was a horrible, wrenching scream of agony from the ring. The wrestlers parted, fought, and before anyone could react, the Contender had the Championed pinned. The count went down.\\n\\nThere was a new Champion.\\n\\nCoach's jaw was on the ground, the towel still in his hand. He was amazed, shocked.\\n\\nThe new Champion was hustled into the locker room, and Coach followed.\\n\\n\"How did you do that? No one has ever got out of The Pretzel!

       "1831  Hey, it happens as you get older NSFW\\n\\n30 years ago I saw a sideshow that touted, \"Harold, the Magnificent Jew\"\\n\\nIntrigued I paid the entrance fee and had a seat in tent with about 50 others.\\n\\nIn the back of the tent was a table on a small stage. The sideshow barker came out with a large fellow in just a bathrobe he introduced as Harold The Magnificent Jew!\\n\\nThe barker then placed 3 whole walnuts spaced out across the table. As a drum roll began off stage the big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK shattering each walnut with his penis. The crowd goes wild with applause.\\n\\nFast forward 30 yrs and I happen to find myself in that same part of town. Sure enough that sideshow tent was still there with the same banner advertising \\n\"Harold, The Magnificent Jew\". I think to myself this can't be the same guy. So curiosity gets the best of me &amp; I again pay the entrance fee.\\n\\nSure enough the stage barker intros the big fellow, now grey and a little hunched over as Harold, The Magnificent Jew. Only this time the barker sets up 3 coconuts across the table. \\n\\nAgain big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK shattering each coconut with his penis. The crowd goes wild with applause.\\n\\nBefore I leave I happen to catch Harold and tell him I first saw his performance 30yrs ago. But that he crushed walnuts back then. So I asked him, what's with him using coconuts now?\\n\\nWith a heavy sigh he confided to me, \"Vell, i have to tell you young man. One day you may have this happen to you too. So if you please don't think too harshly of me.  My apologies but you just have to understand after 30 yrs: \\n\\nMy eyesight just isn't as good as it used to be!

       "6474  I regularly participate in an illegal underground dog fighting ring. Obviously most people find this disgusting and deplorable and i get it, its not for everyone but I've never understood the hate I get when I tell people. I've only ever been beaten up by 2 dogs and Ive won 3 fights (one by technicality) and I dont think that's really too bad of a record.

The salesperson, a young boy, said that only 1kg packs were available in the Store, but the man insisted on buying only 1/2 kg.\\n\\nSo the boy went inside to the manager's room and said \"An idiot outside wants to buy only 1/2 kg of butter\".\\n\\nTo his surprise, the customer was standing right behind him.\\n\\nSo the boy added immediately, \"And this gentleman wants to buy the other half\".\\n\\nAfter the customer left, the manager said \"You have saved your position by being clever enough at the right time. \\nWhere do you come from?\"\\n\\nTo this the boy said, \"I come from Brazil. The place consists of only prostitutes and football players!\"\\n\\nThe manager replied coldly, \"My wife is also from Brazil\".\\n\\nTo this the boy was stunned for a moment,but regained his posture and asked excitedly, \"Oh yeah? Which team does she play for?\"

       "8160  He was pathetic So I walked into a building with tons of kids, don't ask me about it, and then some kid was bullying a younger kid. So, I told him I was going to call his parents. he started crying. I don't know why, he was like 15. I was also never allowed in the orphanage again.

       "2631  This wealthy couple are employing a housemaid. She decides to ask for a raise. She goes to the lady and asks: “Ma’am, I’d like a raise.”\\n\\nThe lady responds: “A raise? But why on earth? I see no reason why.”\\n\\nThe housemaid says: “Well, for starters, I cook better than you, ma’am.”\\n\\nThe lady gets annoyed and replies: “Where does that come from?”\\n“Well, Ma’am, your husband told me he likes the food better when I make it than when you do.”\\n\\nSeriously annoyed, the lady interjects: “I’m not giving you a raise. That’s just your job.”\\n\\nThe housemaid tries again: “And I’m sorry ma’am, but I’m also better at laundry than you.”\\n- “What? What makes you think that?”\\n- “Again I’m sorry ma’am, but your husband says, his shirts are better ironed when I’m the one who cleaned them, than when you are.”\\n\\nEven more annoyed, the lady says: “okay I’ll have a talk with him. But you’re still not getting a raise for doing your job.”\\n\\n“Well... I’m very sorry ma’am, but maybe you should also consider the fact that I’m better at sex than you.”\\n\\nThe lady responds, red with anger: “EXCUSE ME? My HUSBAND told you that?”\\n\\nThe housemaid answers: “Oh, no. The gardener, ma’am.”

Interesting pattern however, is that roles/professions account for many in the lists, including: \"wife\", \"father\", \"doctor\", \"priest\", \"bartender\", and \"president\". Second pattern is some potential sexual words, i.e. \"sex\", \"bed\", \"bar\" etc. The third pattern would be more in-trend words, including \"trump\", and \"covid\"."

    "In conclusion, the logistic regression model vectorized by TfidfVectorizer is the best model for this classification problem. The model has an almost perfect accuracy rate of 98.5% and similar high sensitivity and specificity rate. Besides the fact that I was able to optimize the model to a good extent, it is also likely that the two subreddits are distinctive enough to be classified easily by the model, although in my hypothesis, the two subreddits should be hard to differentiate. In addition, the model also tends to classify based on the length of the texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the findings, one of the key identifiers of Jokes are words as professions, as Tales are usually from first person's perspective. Also people tend to make jokes of current events, which could also be a strong indicator of Jokes. Key identifiers of Tales are not surprisingly retail-related terms such as shop, store, customer, manager and register. Notably \"I work\" is also an important feature as this is usually people tells their own story.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model could be improved even more if it could decrease classifying posts with negative sentiments as jokes, as this would alienate people's feeling when they are looking for ranting."

    "Without doubt, there are several limitations of the project. To start with, the data cleaning could be done more thoroughly. In the later stage of the project, I started to realize that there are some https links mixed in the posts, which never occured to me as I was not a Reddit user and was not familiar with its content structure. This results in hyperlink keywords like \"https\" and \"com\" show up as significant features in TalesfromRetail. It is also the case with \"gt\", a format code in html texts which stands for \"greater than\", which occurs when the text in the post was pasted from somewhere else without reformatting. \"gt\" also shows up in the top 20 significant features. So for my next step, I would like to focus doing a more thorough data cleaning to increase the legitimacy of posts and thus increasing the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the texts were not lemmatized before vectorization, which led to some repetitive features, i.e.\"customer\" and \"customers\" are both in the top 20 significant features for tales. In my future studies, I would like to explore how to effectively incorporate lemmatize into the pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, sentiment analysis seems to be of great help in effectively diminishing the false positive. I would like to explore in the future how to use sentiment analysis as a feature along with the word features in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, one of the target subreddit TalesfromRetail has a strong focus on retail therefore making it easier for the model to classify between two subreddits. However to scale the result, more data other than those from retail should be examined to mitigate the influence of retail terms. "
