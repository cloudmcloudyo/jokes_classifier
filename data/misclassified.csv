"John and Karen were a devoted satanic couple They regularly had to perform a ritual, offering some of their blood, otherwise satan would take their souls away imediately.

So one day, Karen went to the store to buy some salt and scented candles for performing the said ritual.

3 hours passed, until she finally came back home with a plastic bag and a huge smile in her face. John was very worried, and at the same time confused to what was she so happy about. So he asks: “My dear, what took you so long?”

“Well, I went straight to that stupid Chinese manager, as usual, to ask him why wasn’t the salt and the scented candles placed where I wanted them to be. However, he definitely changed his attitude compared to last time! He immediately apologized, remembered me that today is the day that Satan’s birthday is celebrated all over China, and we both ended up doing the ritual over there on the back of the store. After it was over, he gave me this plastic bag with everything I would need.”

So John looks inside the plastic bag, only to find sugar, flour and some small birthday candles.

“but Karen, these are not exactly the ritual materials, he seems to have fooled you! how am I going to perform the ritual with these?!”

“Oh don’t worry dear, that’s going to be a piece of cake”",1,0,0.15471432678554503
"But will this work on my grill? I used to work for a major home improvement company associated with the color orange.  I was a cashier who also had some knowledge of the paint department.  A customer (c) came up to me with a question about paint.  The following conversation ensues (condensed and recalled from memory):

C:  I have a question about paint, can you help me?

Me:  Sure, how can I help you?

C:  This paint says it works on grills, so this should work on my outdoor grill, right?

The paint that she gave me was a paint that was designed for a car grill, not high heat outdoor paint.  This was also automotive paint as there was a picture of a car on the spray can

Me:  I'm afraid not, this is for the grill of a car.

C:  But it says grills on it.

Me:  Yes, but this is not for an outdoor grill, it's for an automotive grill.

C:  But it says grills.

At this point, I can tell that this is going nowhere, so I change tactics. 

Me:  This is automotive paint.  If you are looking for paint for your grill, look for high heat outdoor paint.

With that, she finally understands that she needs a different paint.  I would think that the car on the can or the term automotive on the can would give that away.  Some customers are just really dense.",0,1,0.6986775856333454
"Did you know GTA V was a racing game? This is my sister's actually, she wanted me to post it for her.

My sister used to work for GameStop and of course there would always be kids coming in and wanting to buy M rated games.

One day she had a kid come in and want to buy GTA V, after she explained the procedure to him he fought her for another 5 minutes until he went and got his mom. Well mom comes over.

Mom: ""Why won't you sell my son this game? I demand to know why you won't provide him proper service, this is ridiculous for you to not sell him this game.""
Sis: ""Ma'am, this game is rated M for language, violence, sexual content, sexual violence, drug use and unlawful activity.""

"What do you mean you can change tracks for trains? I have to travel a long way to work every day. The weather here in Toronto was really bad a few days ago to Go Trains were running slow. My train was 30 mins late because of track conditions.   
When I finally get into one, this lady is talking to the transit officer about how she saw a train go west on the same track just 10 minutes before the scheduled time so there was no way the train could have come back east in time. She had no idea that they can send a different train and change tracks for them lmao.  


Lady: Do you think we passengers are stupid? I saw the train go west. I knew it would have never made back in time. Why can't you people plan better.  
Officer: Ma'am, we know trains cannot make back in time. Which is why you get a different train not the same one.  
Lady: Even if it is a different one, two trains cannot run on the same track now can they?

"Hey, it happens as you get older NSFW

30 years ago I saw a sideshow that touted, ""Harold, the Magnificent Jew""

Intrigued I paid the entrance fee and had a seat in tent with about 50 others.

In the back of the tent was a table on a small stage. The sideshow barker came out with a large fellow in just a bathrobe he introduced as Harold The Magnificent Jew!

The barker then placed 3 whole walnuts spaced out across the table. As a drum roll began off stage the big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK shattering each walnut with his penis. The crowd goes wild with applause.

Fast forward 30 yrs and I happen to find myself in that same part of town. Sure enough that sideshow tent was still there with the same banner advertising 
""Harold, The Magnificent Jew"". I think to myself this can't be the same guy. So curiosity gets the best of me &amp; I again pay the entrance fee.

Sure enough the stage barker intros the big fellow, now grey and a little hunched over as Harold, The Magnificent Jew. Only this time the barker sets up 3 coconuts across the table. 

Again big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, WHACK, WHACK, WHACK shattering each coconut with his penis. The crowd goes wild with applause.

Before I leave I happen to catch Harold and tell him I first saw his performance 30yrs ago. But that he crushed walnuts back then. So I asked him, what's with him using coconuts now?

"Long, dumb jokes like THE ARISTOCRATS, Neil Hamburger's ""No Air on Mars"" or Norm McDonald's Moth joke. Anyone know any? Here's one I heard when I was 10. A third grade boy is walking to school and overhears two older girls talking about a ""pink flower"". They notice him there and instantly stop talking.

So, he gets to school and when the class is all taking their seats, he asks the teacher ""Hey, Ms. Rubinslapper, on the way to school today, I heard these two  middle school girls talking about a pink flower, like it was some kind of big secret. What's a pink flower?""

The teacher's face goes red.

""You filthy, disgusting child. You make me SICK! Get out of my sight! Go to the principal's office right now!""

Kid is rather shocked, doesn't know what he's done wrong. Goes to the principal's office (for the first time!) and walks in. The principal, Mr. Hornflogger, is surprised. ""Johnny... what are you doing here?"" he asks. 

Johnny, sheepishly replies ""Well, Mr. Hornflogger, I was walking to school this morning. I heard these two middle school  girls talking about a pink flower. It seemed like some interesting thing, so when I got to class this morning, I asked Ms. Rubinslapper what a pink flower was. She got really angry!""

The boy starts to break down a bit. ""I don't know what I've done wrong, Principal Hornflogger! What is so bad about what I did? What is a pink flower?""

The principal's face goes red, and a vein in his forehead starts pulsating like it's about to erupt.

""You filthy, repulsive sick child! How dare you bring up such subjects around other people, much less AT SCHOOL! I have never encountered such foul behavior from a child. YOU ARE HEREBY EXPELLED!""

So Johnny cleans out his locker, starts walking home. He arrives home around 10am, and his mother is very surprised.

""Johnny, what are you doing home so early? Are you sick? Why didn't the school call?""

Johnny is near-blubbering by now. ""Well, Mom, I was walking to school today as usual, and I heard these two middle school girls talking about a “pink flower”. I didn’t know what it meant, but it sounded like something important, so when I got to school, I asked Ms. Rubinslapper what a pink flower was, and she got really mad and sent me to Principal Hornflogger’s office. I don’t know what I was doing wrong, so I asked him what a pink flower was. He got really angry too and expelled me right on the spot! Mom, I don’t understand what is happening to me today! What is a “pink flower”? What did I do wrong?!?”

The mother sits down at the kitchen table and her voice starts breaking. 

“Ever since you were born, your father and I have done our best to bring you up to be a good boy, a good boy who has morals and follows the rules just like everyone else. Here, today, I find out that I’m a failure as a mother. How could I not see you turning into the revolting piece of human trash you are now? What did I do wrong?”

“Mom?”

“GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE! I never want to see you again!” seethes the mother. 

So Johnny is walking down the street, just crying hiccup-tears, dragging all his belongings in a big duffel bag, pausing each block to sob uncontrollably. 

A policeman passes by. Oh, it’s Officer McClotchkey, the local constable. He knows Johnny and his friends well, and often plays street hockey with them. 

“Johnny… what’s all this?!? What’s the matter? Why are you crying? Why aren’t you in school?!?”… he’s genuinely concerned. 

“Well (sniff) Officer McClotchkey, I was walking to school this morning and I overheard two middle school girls talking about this thing called… I don’t want to say what it is…”

“Oh, come on Johnny, if there’s something you need to talk about, just tell me. Are you in some kind of trouble?” says the officer.

“Well, these two girls (sob) were talking about a “pink flower” like it was some kind of secret… or code or something, I don’t know. It sounded like a normal thing to me, so I went to school and I asked my teacher what a pink flower was, and she got really mad and sent me to the principal’s office. I asked the principal what a pink flower was, and he expelled me from school! I got home and asked my mom what a pink flower was, and she got so angry that she kicked me out of the house!”, the boy half-scream, half-sobbed to the cop.

“Officer McClotchkey, I don’t understand what is so wrong with what I did! What’s a pink flower?!?”

The cop’s demeanor instantly shifts. No longer the sympathetic neighborhood constable, he barks, “Well I’ve never in my 20 years on the force heard such foul rubbish out of one of you kids here in the neighborhood. I wish I could arrest you, but I can’t. But I want you out of this town IMMEDIATELY. You should just join the damn army!”

So the kid, out of resources and out of ideas, thinks “Maybe I will.”

So he goes, joins up, and is soon overseas in (insert name of country that is currently a warzone). 

He’s walking down the street and he sees a much higher-ranked officer, and salutes. The officer notices the boy and is surprised that someone of such obvious young age is in an army uniform, carrying a rifle.

“Private, I’m surprised that someone as young as you joined up. You look like a nice kid, what the hell are you doing in this hellhole?”

“Well, sir…” the boy is weary of telling the story by now, but he obliges the officer. “I was walking to school one day a few months ago, and I heard these two older girls talking about something called a “pink flower”. I didn’t know what it was, so when I got to school, I asked my teacher what a pink flower was. She got really angry and sent me to the principal’s office. I asked the principal what I had done wrong, and I asked him what a pink flower was. He got angry too and kicked me out of school forever! I went home and asked my mom, and she kicked me out of the house and has now disowned me! Then when I was on the streets of my town, I saw a police officer I knew, and when I asked him what a pink flower was, he threatened to arrest me, and he told me to leave town and join the army. And now I’m here.”

The officer pauses, and replies “Pink flower, huh.”

“Yes sir. A pink flower. Do you know what a pink flower is, sir?”

The officer’s face turns beet red “Well never in my years of service to these armed forces have I met a recruit as treasonous and disgusting as you! You’re a disgrace and an insult to the uniform! I’m court-martialing you right now, and I shall recommend a dishonorable discharge! Now get out of my sight!”

The boy is completely defeated. He has nowhere to go. He starts to walk and suddenly he gets run over by a tank.

What’s the moral of the story?

I was in line for a merry-go-round at a theme park and one father was sitting on the horse with a baby on his laps, now this was not just a baby it was basically a newborn, no more than 3 months. He was so tiny and wasn’t even moving his arms. The lady who was running the ride went up to him and said that because the baby was so young, and because the father was an adult they both had to ride on this carriage that was not high off the ground. 

Now this man had a huge ego and would not get off. He kept yelling at this poor lady who is just following the rules. Eventually after around 2 minutes of yelling the lady went and called some supervisors. The 2 men came to the father and kept telling him but he wouldn’t listen, eventually after 5 minutes of the ride being delayed he got off and say in the carriage and told the lady after the supervisors left: “god willing you go to the hell fires”.

I felt so bad for this lady because she was just making sure 1. The baby wouldn’t get hurt, 2. She doesn’t get fired for not enforcing the rules.

TL;DR:
Man in merry-go-round wouldn’t take his newborn son off the horse for safety reasons and after fight with workers and supervisors he caved and wished hell on the lady.  ",0,1,0.6424499325486505

"making a baby The Smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, 'Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon.'

Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.
'Good morning, Ma'am', he said, 'I've come to...'

'Oh, no need to explain,' Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, 'I've been expecting you.'

'Have you really?' said the photographer. 'Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?'

'Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat!'

After a moment she asked, blushing, 'Well, where do we start?'

'Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there.'

'Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!'

'Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'

'My, that's a lot!', gasped Mrs. Smith.

'Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be In and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'

'Don't I know it,' said Mrs. Smith quietly.

The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'This was done on the top of a bus,' he said.

'Oh, my God!' Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.

'And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'

'She was difficult?' asked Mrs. Smith.

'Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look'

'Four and five deep?' said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.

'Yes', the photographer replied. 'And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in.'

Mrs. Smith leaned forward. 'Do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh....equipment?'

'It's true, Ma'am, yes.. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'

'Tripod?'

'Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big to be held in the hand very long.'

"One day a florist went to a barber for a haircut After the cut, he asked about his bill, and the barber replied, 'I cannot accept money from you, I'm doing community service this week.' The florist was pleased and left the shop. When the barber went to open his shop the next morning, there was a 'thank you' card and a dozen roses waiting for him at his door. 


Later, a cop comes in for a haircut, and when he tries to pay his bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you, I'm doing community service this week.' The cop was happy and left the shop.

"Handicapped Accessible This happened a few years ago but we had 2 large unisex bathrooms with a long metal bar by the toilet for making it handicap accessible along with lots of space for a wheelchair. 

Anyways that day we didn’t receive toilet paper for our restrooms and we had the last of it in the bathrooms. Now you know the kind of toilet paper dispensers that hold the large rolls, normal toilet paper cannot fit. We contacted them and we would be receiving it in the morning. In the mean time we placed bought rolls of toilet paper in there in case it ran out. 

A lady in a wheelchair and her husband came in and they went into the one restroom. She came out screaming at me because our bathroom almost made her fall and hurt herself. Someone had placed ONE roll on the hand rail to use (mind you the hand rail is about 3 feet long) and because someone sat one there she had no where to hold onto the rail. She also yelled because we were discriminating against her and it was extremely unsanitary. 

I apologized and told her unfortunately we don’t have access until morning to anymore of the rolls of TP for the dispensers. But that we were trying to keep the restrooms open for customers in the meantime. She continued by telling me that she was going to call the Health Department to tell them what we did and get us in trouble along with other outlets to make us “pay”. 

It still baffles me... no one forced her to use our bathroom! And her finding the TP unsanitary for being sat out... little does she know that several times we had men piss up into the dispenser. At least with it out you can see if it’s clean or not.",0,1,0.5195978520012887

"I just got a new motorcycle... I just got a new motorcycle, in fact my first one.  
I was so happy that I decided to go the Shrine in the top of a near mountain to get it blessed.  
Everything was fine until a few miles before the slope even beings I saw a police control area, as it was my first bike I didn't have a license yet, I even haven't got the registration for the bike, I tought that I was screwed, then I got an idea.  
I got off from the bike and I started pushing it, when I reach the control the cop ask me what I was doing with the bike, so I told them, that when I started saving for my bike I promise that when I get it I would go the shrine pushing it.  
The cop hear my story and let me pass astonished about my determination, I though, after a a mile I hop in again and here we go, but after a few meters I hear something behind me, it was a patrol car, so I ask them, anything that I can do for you officers? they told me:  
""We all were so impressed about your determination that we decided to escort you to keep you safe""",1,0,0.34019037350231096

"Full of S.H.I.T. In order to assure the highest levels of quality work and productivity from students, it will be our policy to keep all students well taught through our program of Special High Intensity Teaching (S.H.I.T.). We are trying to give our students more S.H.I.T. than anyone else.

If you feel that you do not receive your share of S.H.I.T. on the course, please see your lecturer. You will be immediately placed at the top of the S.H.I.T. list, and our lecturers are especially skilled at seeing that you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.

Students who don't take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in Departmental Educational Evaluation Programs (D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T.). Those who fail to take D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go to Educational Attitude Training (E.A.T. S.H.I.T.). Since our lecturers took S.H.I.T. before they graduated, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. anymore, and are all full of S.H.I.T. already.

If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be interested in a job teaching others. We can add your name to our Basic Understanding Lecture List (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).

For students who are intending to pursue a career in management and consultancy, we will refer you to the department of Managerial Operational Research Education (M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.). This course emphasizes on how to manage M.O.R.E. S.H.I.T.

If you have further questions, please direct them to our Head Of Teaching, Special High Intensity Training (H.O.T. S.H.I.T.).

"Welcome to waddle house! This was a few months ago back when I worked for a certain restaurant known for their waffles.

Anyways me and my coworker had a thing where we said, ""Welcome to Waffle House! Where every meal is a Happy meal."" It was the only thing that kept us sane. 

Well this little girl probably 4 or 5 ends up copying us and saying it to every single customer on their way in, except she said waddle house. Easily the cutest thing I've ever seen there.",0,1,0.6879153197422418
